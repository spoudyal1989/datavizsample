# Dynasties in Democracies

### What I Want to Know
Democracies guard against tyrannies, against family rules (although this statement might ring hollow to many, if not most, people in post-2016 United States). Conventional wisdom holds that periodical elections, separation of powers, and a regard for the rule of law check base political ambitions and ensure that politicians do not hold elected office for decades. In reality, exceptions to this conventional wisdom exist in many more democracies than just the United States. 

I am interested, in particular, in political dynasties in democracies. Among the 116 democracies that I present in this post, 48 of them have had members of a successive generation serving as the head of state or of government within the past four decades. Think Justin Trudeau (whose father was the Canadian prime minister from 1980 to 1984) or George W. Bush (son of George H.W. Bush, who was president from 1989 to 1993).

What explains the entrenchment of dynasties in democracies? When voters elect to national office the child of a previously elected officeholder, name recognition and incumbency advantage certainly advantage the dynastic victor. But are there factors inherent to a country’s electoral or governmental systems, or deriving from its history, that explain why democracies have political families in national politics? I will show with my visualization that there are.

### Why People Might Be Interested in This Question
Democracies of all kinds feature political dynasties, and no one factor is a decisive indicator of whether a country has a legacy of political dynasties or whether it might in the future. This research aims to contribute to the exceedingly wide and deep area of inquiry into political families that persist in democracies. Anyone interested in comparative politics might find this research useful.

### What I Studied and Found
This research uses the list of countries that Freedom House identifies as being democracies in its annual reports. Of the countries surveyed for the last twenty-eight years by the Freedom House, I consider as a democracy only those countries that have been categorized as democracies—partly or fully—for at least fourteen of the past twenty-eight years.  

The visualization shows four independent variables and one dependent variable. The first, <i>electoral system</i>, is divided into three categories: proportional representational system, plurality/majority, and mixed. These categories are based on the electoral system family developed by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. <i>System of government</i> is divided into three broad categories: parliamentary democracy/parliamentary constitutional monarchy, parliamentary republic/federal parliamentary republic, and presidential republic/semipresidential republic. The visualization also shows whether or not a country is a <i>monarchy</i> and whether it gained <i>independence before or after 1945</i>. Monarchy was chosen because it is generally posited that in countries with monarchies, other political families are generally not prominent. The independence variable is meant to check whether a colonial past has any effect on a country’s tolerance for dynastic elites in national politics.

<b>I found that democracies with plurality/majority electoral systems or mixed electoral have more families in national politics than those with proportional representation system. This variable amplifies the effect of other variables as well.</b>

### How to Read This Visualization

The visualization shows five maps, all of them interactive. By hovering the mouse over any color-filled country on any map, a user can learn about five distinct features of the country. Even without using the interactive tools, a user can tell which countries share which features and whether those countries are physically proximate.

### Why Things Look the Way They Do

I decided that a map would be appropriate for this visualization because only a map would show the level of information without appearing too busy. Because there are five maps, each with its own legends, I decided to use one color scheme for the “master” map and one scheme for the four on the bottom so that the visualization wouldn’t appear cluttered. I considered whether using the same color scheme for four adjacent maps would confuse the user and decided that it wouldn’t because I would insert the legend for each map right on top of it. One other reason I inserted the legend on top of each map was that when a user selects one country in any of the five maps, only the legend for the applicable value is retained; a user can therefore get information from five maps by simply hovering the mouse over any one map.

### How I Can Improve

I would like to be able to manage the filter such that when a country is clicked on on one map, only that country is zoomed in on other four maps. If I were to reiterate this visualization—and given it is possible—I would create a heat map that would change according to the significance of the value of a variable associated with a country.
