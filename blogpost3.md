# Dynasties in Democracies

### What I Want to Know
It is not unheard of for several members and successive generations of one family to be part of the government in nonrepresentational systems. However, the persistence of political families in democracies around the world raises the question: what explains the entrenchment of dynasties in democracies? When voters have the right to elect to office individuals whom they see fit and they vote for the child of a previously elected officeholder, one may consider factors such as name recognition and incumbency advantage to have played a role. But are there factors inherent to a countryâ€™s electoral or governmental systems, or deriving from its history, that explain why democracies have political families in national politics? Do these countries have anything in common?

### Why One Might Be Interested in This Question
Democracies of all kinds feature political dynasties, and no one factor is a decisive indicator of whether a country has a legacy of political dynasties or whether it might in the future. This research aims to contribute to the exceedingly wide and deep area of inquiry into political families that persist in democracies. Anyone interested in comparative politics might find this research useful.
