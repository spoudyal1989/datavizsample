# Dynasties in Democracies

### What I Want to Know
It is not unheard of for several members and successive generations of one family to be part of the government in nonrepresentational systems. However, the persistence of political families in democracies around the world raises the question: what explains the entrenchment of dynasties in democracies? When voters have the right to elect to office individuals whom they see fit and they vote for the child of a previously elected officeholder, one may consider factors such as name recognition and incumbency advantage to have played a role. But are there factors inherent to a country’s electoral or governmental systems, or deriving from its history, that explain why democracies have political families in national politics? Do these countries have anything in common?

### Why One Might Be Interested in This Question
Democracies of all kinds feature political dynasties, and no one factor is a decisive indicator of whether a country has a legacy of political dynasties or whether it might in the future. This research aims to contribute to the exceedingly wide and deep area of inquiry into political families that persist in democracies. Anyone interested in comparative politics might find this research useful.

### Data and Findings
This research uses the list of countries that Freedom House identifies as being democracies in its annual reports. Of the countries surveyed for the last twenty-eight years by the Freedom House, I consider as a democracy only those countries that have been categorized as democracies—partly or fully—for at least fourteen of the past twenty-eight years.  
The visualization shows four independent variables and one dependent variable. The first, <i>electoral system</i>, is divided into three categories: proportional representational system, plurality/majority, and mixed. These categories are based on the electoral system family developed by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. <i>System of government</i> is divided into three broad categories: parliamentary democracy/parliamentary constitutional monarchy, parliamentary republic/federal parliamentary republic, and presidential republic/semipresidential republic. The visualization also shows whether or not a country is a <i>monarchy</i> and whether it gained <i>independence before or after 1945</i>. Monarchy was chosen because it is generally posited that in countries with monarchies, other political families are generally not prominent. The independence variable is meant to check whether a colonial past has any effect on a country’s tolerance for dynastic elites in national politics.
I found that democracies with plurality/majority electoral systems or mixed electoral have more families in national politics than those with proportional representation system. This variable amplifies the effect of other variables as well.
