# Visualizing Political Dynasties in Democracies

>### Abstract
>Family rule is often thought to be a feature of nonrepresentational governments, but democracies also have their fair share of political dynasties. This trend bucks conventional wisdom that periodical elections, separation of powers, and a regard for the rule of law check base political ambitions and ensure that politicians do not hold elected office for decades. While scholars have shown a correlation between incumbency advantage and persistence of political families in democracies, this paper discusses the analysis and the visualization of the correlation between systemic issues—those that candidates do not control, even though they can manipulate such issues—and political dynasties in democracies. The visualization portrays country-level variables that are normalized by statistical calculations with the goal of enabling granular comparisons among democracies. 

### Research background and findings

When voters have the right to elect to office individuals whom they see fit and they vote for the same person or a family member of that person, several factors may be considered, name recognition and incumbency advantage being most frequently cited. In addition to these factors, systemic reasons might explain the endurance of political dynasties in democracies: electoral system, system of government, and colonial history, among others. To this end, I hypothesize that democracies with direct elections have a higher incidence of political families than democracies with proportional elections.

The research uses the list of countries that Freedom House identifies as being democracies in its annual reports. Of the countries surveyed for the last twenty-eight years by the Freedom House, the research considers as democracies only those countries that have been categorized as democracies—partly or fully—for at least fourteen of the past twenty-eight years.

The dataset consists four independent variables and one dependent variable. Electoral System is one independent variable (IV); it is divided into three categories: proportional representational system, plurality/majority, and mixed. These categories are based on the electoral system family developed by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. System of Government is another IV and is also divided into three categories: parliamentary democracy/parliamentary constitutional monarchy, parliamentary republic/federal parliamentary republic, and presidential republic/semipresidential republic.  Two other independent variables account for whether or not the country is a monarchy and whether it became independent before or after 1945. Monarchy is chosen because it is generally posited that in countries with monarchies, other political families are generally not prominent. The independence IV is meant to show whether a colonial past has any effect on a country’s tolerance for dynastic elites in national politics.

The dependent variable Legacy is simply defined as the fact of individuals from successive generations in one family becoming a head of government or head of state. Because the democracy rankings of the countries examined begin in 1988, the accounting for a familial head of state or government begins at 1980. I believe this allows sufficient room for a generational change in national politics. This stipulation produces a sample of 116 democracies. Legacy is a binary variable in this dataset. Regardless of how many families have had members of successive generations as head of state or government, Legacy only registers yes and no.

Among the independent variables modeled, Electoral System can help explain the persistence of political families in democracies. Specifically, democracies with plurality/majority electoral systems or mixed electoral have more families in national politics than those with proportional representation system. Or, democracies with proportional representation (PR) have fewer political dynasties than do democracies with other forms of electoral systems. 

One of the reasons might be that in plurality/majority systems, if a child of a current officeholder wishes to succeed to the parent’s elected position, name recognition, scare-off effect, and access to resources would work in favor of the new candidate. However, in the case of party-list PR, a new candidate would go lower on the list, which diminishes their chances of getting elected. Moreover, plurality-based electoral systems are first-past-the-post within smaller electoral area. In PR system, the electoral areas would be increased and individuals would be awarded seats based on the percentage of the votes their party gathered.

### Data Decisions

The statistical modeling provides a comparison between democracies with different kinds of electoral systems; however, the factor of comparison is derived from residuals. No two democracies are similar, even with respect to just the four IVs that were studied. Therefore, I wanted to produce a visualization that would capture the values of all five variables for all the 116 democracies. A map was my choice of visualization. The general idea of this visualization was to enable distant reading, as discussed by Franco Moretti: I wanted to make it possible for users to look at the entire sample and see the relationships between values across five variables simultaneously and instantaneously while still keeping the inapplicable values in the background. 

><b>[See visualization here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sumit.poudyal#!/vizhome/Portfolio_43/OriginalDashboard).</b>

The first map I decided on was the one for the dependent variable (i.e., whether a democracy has had dynastic legacy since 1980). Because the value of this variable would be of most interest, I wanted to make it prominent. Therefore, I placed it on the top left of the dashboard so that it occupied more than one-quarter of the dashboard area. Below this “master map,” I arranged four smaller maps—each of which displayed the values of the four IVs for each of the 116 countries—identical in size, each adjacent to the other.

Even though the five maps all displayed different values, I wanted to create a streamlined visual look for the legends. Therefore, I chose bright hues for the two legends in the master map; I used the same color combination for the accompanying text and a non-interactive bar diagram that separated the text from the master map. Similarly, I chose deeper hues for the IV legends, and kept the hues consistent across the bottom four maps, all appearing in a particular order. All the hues used in the graphic are colorblind-safe. 

I made the bar chart as a means to keep the introductory text visually separate from the map. Because the bar chart is proximate to the map and uses the same colors for legends as the map does, I chose to not make the bar chart interactive. I also considered but eventually decided against changing the number values on the bar chart to percentage values. The numbers on the bar chart represent democracies (forty-eight and sixty-eight); if I converted those numbers to percentages, I suspected a user might read those percentages as proportion of all the countries in the world instead of just that of the 116 countries in the sample. 

I activated the highlight action on my dashboard such that if a user hovered a mouse over a country on any of one map, the other four maps would highlight respective values for that country only. Additionally, while the highlight made the applicable value appear prominently, the other values would only dim in the map and the legends so that a user could still look at the other values. I also disabled the option to keep or exclude the selected country on the map in order to prevent a user from inadvertently doing so, the reason for the restrictive design choice being that the user did not derive additional utility from the option. A filter and legends are superimposed on the top right corner of the master map; this was consciously done because the countries on the top right of the map (Russia and China) are not in the sample. However, I was shown, during studio review, how a user could zoom in on or pan the map in such a manner that the sample countries would appear behind the legend. The zooming in and panning could also make the visualization cumbersome to drive. And finally, if a user zoomed in on one map, the other maps would still remain at original size; therefore, the highlighted portions that the user saw would not be visually identical across all maps. Therefore, I made another restrictive design choice by taking away the user’s ability to navigate the map by zooming in or panning.

Finally, while I enabled the tooltip to show respective values for each variable, I added all variables to the tooltip for the master map so that a user may see the description of all variables in one place while the applicable legends are highlighted in the smaller maps to make for an easy reading.   

### Reflections

Data visualization is an effective tool to convey multilayered information in an accessible format that presumably is less time-consuming to read than an explanatory text would be. However, as Miriam Posner argues, the need for “transparency, seamlessness, and flow, privilege ease of use ahead of any kind of critical engagement (even, perhaps, struggle) with the material at hand.”  I felt this limitation the most when thinking about incorporating the results of the statistical modeling into the visualization. 

My full research uses an additional dependent variable, Number of Families Currently Active in National Politics; this is a numerical variable based on which a correlation can be shown: for every 100 families in national politics in a democracy with a proportional representational electoral system, there are 145 such families in a democracy with a plurality/majority or mixed electoral system. In the interest of a cleaner categorical distinction, I forewent this variable in the dataset that I used to build the visualization. 

Similarly, many students and scholars of comparative politics will rightly point out that dividing System of Government into only three categories is lazy, if not sometimes misleading; for example, could presidential and semi-presidential systems truly be considered one category? The answer would be yes if one were to consider France; it would be no in the case of Taiwan.

Most important, I think, is the question of what a democracy is. The Freedom House categorization has weaknesses; the parameters I imposed on that categorization have helped address erstwhile consensus and biases (e.g., although the United States in the pre-Civil Rights era was considered a democracy then, that surely would not be the case for a similar country in 2018), my parameters still do not consider how democratic a country is.

The data trade-offs that I made helped a cleaner visualization, but they do not capture the granularity that would be ideal, albeit not quite desirable. A future iteration would seek to incorporate granularity without intruding on the visual elements. To that end, I would actively think about visualizations that are as effective as maps but allow more values to be represented cleanly.
