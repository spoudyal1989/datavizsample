# Water Leaks in NYC Residential Buildings

## Introduction

Every day, New York City residents call 311 to record complaints about infrastructure and services. Many of those complaints are more frequent in one area of the city than the other. I am interested in examining the distribution of complaints of water leaks in residential buildings in the city. I specifically want to know which months have the highest numbers of water leakage complaints and whether such complaints are clustered in a particular borough.  

Complaints of water leakage are routed to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. If a pattern of these complaints exists—and can be demonstrated—the department can use the knowledge to direct resources to resolve the issue efficiently and effectively.
