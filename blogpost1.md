# Water Leaks in NYC Residential Buildings

##Introduction##

Every day, New York City residents call 311 to record complaints about infrastructure and services. Many of those complaints are more frequent in one area of the city than the other. I am interested in examining the distribution of complaints of water leaks in residential buildings in the city. I specifically want to know which months have the highest numbers of water leakage complaints and whether such complaints are clustered in a particular borough.
