# Water Leaks in NYC Residential Buildings

Every day, New York City residents call 311 to record complaints about infrastructure and services. Many of those complaints are more frequent in one area of the city than the other. I am interested in examining the distribution of complaints of water leaks in residential buildings in the city. I specifically want to know which months have the highest numbers of water leakage complaints and whether such complaints are clustered in a particular borough.  

Complaints of water leakage are routed to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. If a pattern of these complaints exists—and can be demonstrated—the department can use the knowledge to direct resources to resolve the issue efficiently and effectively.

The graph above shows 311 service requests (complaints) for “water-leaks” in residential buildings in New York City in 2011, disaggregated by borough. The vertical axis simply shows the number of complaints made (or records created). The horizontal axis shows months in 2011 from March through December, months in which the records were created. The line for each borough is color-coded differently; the legend can be consulted on the left-hand side of the graph. Each line contains nodes that indicate the total number of complaints filed each month. The highest and the lowest numbers of complaints for each borough are noted on the graph. Totals for each month can be viewed by hovering the mouse over the line for the desired borough.
