# How I <strike>Say</strike> Write Thank You

### Introduction
<i>Many thanks!</i>

This was how a coworker ended an email to me about a year ago. That was probably the first time I had come across that expression, at least in writing. I liked the expression, warmer than <i>thanks</i> and less stuffy than <i>thank you</i>. So I adopted it, in what scholars ([many thanks, Michelle!](.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih2azjq2Hr0)) call linguistic convergence. 

As I was flipping through a copy of <i>Dear Data</i> in class last week, I came across a visualization of how often the authors say thank you. That visualization reminded me of the expression I had picked up a year or so ago. I suspected I had adopted the expression with such zealotry that I was overusing it, not just for the special moments that I originally wanted to save it for.
