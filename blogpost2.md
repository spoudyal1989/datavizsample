# How I <strike>Say</strike> Write Thank You

### Research Question and Audience

<i>Many thanks!</i>

This was how a coworker ended an email to me about a year ago. That was probably the first time I had come across that expression, at least in writing. I liked the expression, warmer than <i>thanks</i> and less stuffy than <i>thank you</i>. So I adopted it, in what language scholars ([many thanks, Michelle!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih2azjq2Hr0)) call linguistic convergence. 

As I was flipping through a copy of <i>Dear Data</i> in class last week, I came across a visualization of how often the authors said thank you. That visualization reminded me of the expression I had picked up a year or so ago. I suspected I had adopted the expression with such zealotry that I was overusing it, not just for the special moments that I originally wanted to save it for.  

So my question was: How do I express my gratitude in my email responses? Which expressions do I use, how frequently do I use each expression, do I place the expressions in one place in my email more than in others, and do I use these expressions more for certain people? 

### Data and Findings

I looked at emails from the past month (May 2018) in the Sent folder in my work Outlook to gather data for this visualization. I searched the Sent folder only because I rarely write <i>thank you</i> or its variations in an email that I start. And I limited the scope to one month only because of the number of the emails I had to search (approximately 300). 

I found that I had three main ways of expressing gratitude in my email responses: <i>thanks</i>, <i>thank you</i>, and—my special one—<i>many thanks</i>. Only in one email had I used <i>my thanks</i>. Another finding was that out of the 300-odd emails, I had used one of the three expressions in ninety-nine emails. No expression had been used more than once in any email. 

However, I did not distribute my expressions of gratitude equally across recipients or even within emails. I was more thankful to my superiors (mostly because I was responding to feedback rather than providing information, as would be the case with peers). And I opened or ended an email with an expression more than I used an expression in the body of the email.

<b>I had not used as many <i>many thanks</i> as I suspected (my guess was around half the time). But I had used the expression more when writing to peers than to superiors, which I thought would have been the case. I may be converging but not mimicking, just yet.</b>

The findings are presented in the visualization below.

### All the Thank-Yous in All My Emails

The visualization dashboard below attempts to answer the various questions I raised above. Because the total number of emails is ninety-nine, the numeral frequency of each measure also approximates the proportion (in percentage) of each measure.

The topmost bar chart shows how many times I used each of the three expressions in my emails. The pie charts shows whom among my superiors and peers I write more expressions of gratitude to. The adjacent bar chart shows where in my emails expressions appear the most. The last bar chart compares the frequency of the expressions and their position in my emails to my superiors and peers. Depending on the platform on which they are viewing the dashboard below (computer, tablet, or phone), users may need to scroll through the dashboard to fully view the final bar chart.

### Design Decisions and Room for Improvement

I chose bar charts, because they provided a clean and clear way of presenting the data, even at complex levels. I also decided in favor of horizontal bar charts because they took up less space while presenting the same level of information. Because each bar chart was presenting about different values, I decided to use the same color but different saturation levels. I also made the hue lighter from top to bottom to provide an easier transition to a user. I decided to make the second chart a pie chart because only two values were being compared, so a simple presentation seemed to work well in that case. 

As noted above, I thanked my superiors almost 35 percent more than I did my peers. I would like to reflect the proportional difference in my charts so that I have a more granular visualization of these expressions.
