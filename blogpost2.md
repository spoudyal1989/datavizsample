# How I <strike>Say</strike> Write Thank You

### Research Question and Audience

<i>Many thanks!</i>

This was how a coworker ended an email to me about a year ago. That was probably the first time I had come across that expression, at least in writing. I liked the expression, warmer than <i>thanks</i> and less stuffy than <i>thank you</i>. So I adopted it, in what language scholars ([many thanks, Michelle!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih2azjq2Hr0)) call linguistic convergence. 

As I was flipping through a copy of <i>Dear Data</i> in class last week, I came across a visualization of how often the authors say thank you. That visualization reminded me of the expression I had picked up a year or so ago. I suspected I had adopted the expression with such zealotry that I was overusing it, not just for the special moments that I originally wanted to save it for.  

So my question was: How do I express my gratitude in my email responses? Which expressions do I use, how frequently do I use each expression, do I place the expressions in one place in my email more than in others, and do I use these expressions more for certain people? 

### Data

I looked at emails from the past month (May 2018) in the Sent folder in my work Outlook to gather data for this visualization. I searched the Sent folder only because I rarely write <i>thank you</i> or its variations in an email that I start. And I limited the scope to one month only because of the number of the emails I had to search in (approximately 300). I found that I have three main ways of expressing gratitude in my email responses: <i>thanks</i>, <i>thank you</i>, and—my special one—<i>many thanks</i>.
