# How I <strike>Say</strike> Write Thank You

### Introduction
Many thanks! 

This was how a coworker ended an email to me about a year ago. That was probably the first time I had come across that expression, at least in writing. I liked the expression, warmer than <i>thanks</end> and less stuffy than <i>thank you</end>. So I adopted it, in what scholars ([many thanks, Michelle!](.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih2azjq2Hr0) ) call linguistic convergence. 
As I was flipping through a copy of <i>Dear Data</> in class last week, I came across a visualization of how often the authors say thank you. The idea of tracking thank-yous reminded me of a habit that I had picked up a year or so ago.
